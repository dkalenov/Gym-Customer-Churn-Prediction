# Gym Customer Churn Prediction

## Project objectives

Develop gym customer churn prediction models

## Tasks
- Perform in-depth analysis of customer churn data;
- Determine the presence and influence of correlation data;
- Create a profile of customers with a high probability of churn;
- Train models for customer churn prediction;
- Achieve recall 93% on test data.

## Conclusion

The final model for predicting customer churn is based on Gradient Boosting. The 'recall' metric of the test data is 0.937. 

The client who is more likely to leave the fitness center is likely to have the following characteristics:
- has 2 months or less remaining in their contract;
- Does not participate in group visits;
- is under the age of 26;
- has a low level of average additional charges;
- has a lifetime of only 2 months since their first visit;
- has a low average weekly class frequency (both in general and in the current month).

## Further development

- Train a model to cluster clients into more precise classification groups;
- Determine more specific profiles of clients who will remain in the center and who will leave.
